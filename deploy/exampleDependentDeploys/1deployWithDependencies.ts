/**
 * @dev How does having these deploy commands effect multi-contract
 *      deployments?
 * 
 * Commands in `package.json`: 
 * "evmDeploy": "yarn hardhat --network localhost deploy --tags",
 * "ovmDeploy": "yarn hardhat --network staging deploy --tags"
 * 
 * @notice Caveats:
 *     1. Cannot chain deploys with a command itself, e.g. something like the
 *        following does NOT work:
 *        `yarn evmDeploy ERC20 ERC20-ovm` || `yarn ovmDeploy ERC20 ERC20-ovm`
 * 
 *     2. Tedious to run consecutive deploys by repeating the deploy command:
 *        `yarn evmDeploy contract1 && yarn evmDeploy contract2 && ...`
 * 
 * @notice Sol:
 *     1. [CUR-SOL] Specify whether deploy is for EVM or OVM in `.json` name itself.
 *        This approach still needs to use a custom node-deploy script in 
 *        `package.json` 
 * 
 *     2. Use custom `hardhat-deploy` to auto-detect whether `.json` is for EVM
 *        or OVM. 
 *        However, EVM and OVM deploys require different networks which makes this 
 *        approach difficult. 
 *        This approach would also use a custom node-deploy script in `package.json` 
 *        (since the solution I imagine would be to add another flag to the 
 *        hardhat-deploy CLI to enable EVM or OVM deploys).
